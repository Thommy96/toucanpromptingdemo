        <!-- Explanation -->
    
        <h3>Baseline - TTS system without additional conditioning prompt</h3>
        <p>The baseline TTS system generates speech directly from the given text input, without any additional conditioning prompts. This approach serves as a foundation for comparison.</p>
        
        <h3>Proposed - TTS system additionally conditioned on natural language prompts</h3>
        <p>The proposed TTS system takes advantage of natural language prompts for enhanced prosody control. By conditioning the generation process on these prompts, the goal is to achieve more expressive and contextually appropriate speech output. Thereby the produced speech prosody is expected to rely on the (emotional) content of the prompt.</p>
